## MinimumEditDistance
# Java Swing application that implements Minimum Edit Distance algorithm. 
In natural language processing, edit distance is a way to find the minimum number of operations needed to transform one string to another. 
In other words, it is a way to quantify how dissimilar two words are to one another.

This application has two main functionalities: one that takes an input and lists its first five alternative
words (nearest five words) by using the dictionary provided. (Dictionary is Turkish however it can be changed);
